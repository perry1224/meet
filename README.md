## Description

This app provides a list of upcoming events for any given city, with data provided by Google Calendar. The app works offline using cached data from the last time it was used online. 
The user can search for events in a specific city or browse all events, customize how many events are shown on screen, click an event for more details, 
and see how many events are upcoming in certain cities.

## How to Use This App

When first opening the app, you will be prompted to sign in with Google in order to gain access to the Google Calendar API. Then, you can specify what city and how many events to view,
and click on an event to view more details!

## Reflection on this project
My role in this project is to create an interactive website using various testing such as unit testing and end-to-end testing to make sure there are no bugs
prior to putting it to the public. Being new to testing, there were frequent errors I encounter and despite reading the errors it was a challenge trying to comprehend
how to resolve it. My mentor and tutor were patient with me in explaining what those errors mean and how to fix it. One important lesson I learned is the importance of testing.
Jest is such an invaluable tool that I wish it was introduced sooner into my program. I definitely would use it more for my future projects.
